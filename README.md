# MyPassport

A guide to the countries of the world. Choose from the drop-down lists at left to see information about each country. This work-in-progress uses an Excel .csv file as its data source. I aim to add datascraping to keep the fields current and to add account management so that users can save which countries they have visited. World leaders and other data are currently updated as of May, 2019.
